- Do **not** use fallback solutions, temporary builds, or quick fixes.  
- Do **not** use mock data, hardcoded test data, or fake implementations.  
- All code must be **production-ready, clean, and scalable**.  
- If something is unclear or missing, you must **stop and ask for clarification** instead of making assumptions or inserting placeholders.  
- Always prioritize **correct implementation over speed**.  
- Follow **best practices** and build with long-term maintainability in mind.
- **NEVER** do anything unnecessary or redundant in important processes.
